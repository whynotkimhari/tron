# tron
Tron is a fast-paced arcade game where players control light cycles that leave trails behind, aiming to trap opponents and avoid crashing into walls, trails, or their own path.

# easy to play
fork/pull/clone this repo, run the `run.bat` file.

# caution
make sure you have `mysql` on your machine and run `tron.sql` to create the database before start the game.
